The Irish word list is generated from two smaller previous lists I found: Michal Boleslav Měchura's list, 2015, accessed via https://github.com/michmech/irish-word-frequency; and an uncredited Google Doc at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A6FUrSO_Y-GhyuZNnho97AeE0f4kRucWH3HYpOXR3xY/edit?gid=0#gid=0. 'Source' is marked as: MM if from the Mechura list; GDoc if from the Google document; and CM if I have added it.

Additional words are added via letter, letter combination, and symbol (accent) searches in 20 years of Dáil Éireann transcripts, from 2004 to the end of 2024. Transcripts are scraped from kildarestreet.com.

All words are lowercased, but not lemmatized. The total number of terms is 20,323.

The 'English' column reflects whether a word is also valid in English, per passing either a US English or GB English spellcheck in the R hunspell package.

Please note that proper nouns such as place names and people's names may remain in the data; I have made some passes through to remove URLs, words from other languages that contain accents, etc. but please note some may remain. Hyphenated words are phrases that contain partly Irish and partly English words are retained.
